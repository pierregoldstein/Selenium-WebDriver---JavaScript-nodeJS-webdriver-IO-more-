'browser.execute(script, arguments)' - Inject a snippet of JavaScript into the page for execution in the context of 
the currently selected frame. The executed script is assumed to be synchronous and the result of evaluating the
script is returned to the client.

The script argument defines the script to execute in the form of a function body. The value returned by that 
function will be returned to the client. The function will be invoked with the provided args array and the 
values may be accessed via the arguments object in the order specified.

Arguments may be any JSON-primitive, array, or JSON object. JSON objects that define a WebElement reference 
will be converted to the corresponding DOM element. Likewise, any WebElements in the script result will be 
returned to the client as WebElement JSON objects.

1.  We can also execute commands or scripts inline with established pages to test functionality, e.g:  Playing 
or pausing a video on a webpage by using console in developers tools of your browser.  'execute()'  will allow 
us to add these inline with our test.
