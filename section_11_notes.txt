Chai assertions

1.  Chai provides further capability to adding assertions to your test.

2.  npm install chai@latest -save -dev

3.  Create a file name chaitest.js in the test folder of your project directory.  3 different styles 
of assertions in chai:

var assert = require('chai').assert;
var expect = require('chai').expect;
var should = require('chai').should();

var actual = 1;
var expected = 2;

assert.equal(actual.expected);
expect(actual).to.equal(expected);
actual.should.equal.(expected);

4.  To target just the chai test, we can use 'npm test -- --spec=tests/chaitest.js'

5.  Lets modify the WebDriverIOUniveristy.js file by removing the require('assert') to:
var expect = require('chai').expect;
var should = require('chai').should();

and removing are current assertions with:

expect(title).to.equal('WebDriverUniversity.com');
title.should.equal('WebDriverUniversity.com');

6.  To centralize our assertions,  go to the wdio.conf.js file and uncomment the before object.  
Inside the function, take the newly required assertions we have in the WebDriverIOUniveristy.js and 
place them in the before functon like so:

expect = require('chai').expect;
should = require('chai').should();

Be sure to remove the var as its not needed.  This change wll keep us from having to constantly 
require the new assertions in the case we are running multiple test.

7.  Remove var expect = require('chai').expect & var should = require('chai').should() from the top of
the WebDriverIOUniveristy.js file and save it.  Run the test.
