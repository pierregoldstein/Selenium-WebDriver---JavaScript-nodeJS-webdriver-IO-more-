Jenkins Introduction

Jenkins is a tool that can automate your project.  If you wanted to schedule test to execute at different 
times, you can.  Jenkin creates builds and automates those builds when scheduled.  Jenkins allows you to 
execute our framework on its own.

Go to  jenkins.io and download 'generic java war file'.  Save it in an acessible location and open gitbash 
from that location.  Once open run 'java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=5555' 
***Note - --httpPort=xxxx is used to specify a port because by default jkenkins uses port 8080 ***
Installation will be complete when you see 'jenkins is fully up and running', after the installation, open 
your browser and naviagte to http://localhost:5555.
When you navigate to the page, it will ask you for a password and give you a location tp find the password.  
Copy and paste the password from that location, E.g: C:\Users\Pierre\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword
Once in the installation page click 'installed suggested plug-ins'.  Once files are installed it will take you 
to 'Create First Admin User'.  Fill in the info accordingly.  Click 'save and continue; and then confirm the
url and port.  The next time you run Jenkins after a shutdown, run 'java -jar jenkins.war' as you do not a port
because that was setup om the installation. Upon startup, type inthe user name and pasword that you created.


Once logged into jenkins homepage, go to 'manage jenkins' then 'manage plugins' and finally click on the 
'available' tab, install nodejs, html publisher & post build-task without restart.

Once files are installed, click 'manage jenkins' then 'global tool configuration'. Click add nodejs, give it a name and in 
'Global npm packages to install' type 'bower@~1.8.0 grunt-cli@~1.2.0'. Click apply and save.

Finally we will click 'configure system'. go to 'global properties' and click 'enviromental variables'.  Then click add, in the 
Name box type in 'PATH" and Value '$PATH:C:/Program Files/nodejs/node_modules/npm/bin'. Click apply and save.
