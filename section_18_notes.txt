1.  Go to npm.org and look up the info to install 'sync-request',  'sync-request' allows you to hit an endpoint 
and load data into your request, e.g: adding json data to our test cases.

'sync-request' - Make synchronous web requests with cross-platform support.

npm install --save-dev syn-request, is the command to install

After installing we need to update some variable for syn request and get ready to start using json data in our 
contactUsTest.js file.

After setting up data change the enail and body datat with the newly parsed json datat using a forEach loop 
and making sure that we only run one test, we will use it.only.
