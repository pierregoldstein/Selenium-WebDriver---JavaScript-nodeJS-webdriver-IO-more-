Mocha Hooks

1.  Navigate to Mochajs.org and look up the hooks section.  With hooks, functions can be executed before, after, before each and after each test.

2.  Go to Webdriveruniveristy.com and go to the 'contact us' section.  Here we can wire up a test suite of test and hooks to test the 'contact us' form.

3.  Lets get the url of the 'contact us' page, http://www.webdriveruniversity.com/Contact-Us/contactus.html, but remember, we only need '/Contact-Us/contactus.html' 
as we have the url saved in baseUrl on the wdio.conf.js file located in the root directory.

4.  Now lets add the boiler plate code and add the 'beforeEach()' hook and add the url so we can trigger that before running the test.

5.  Now us the inspect toll and create the locators to test the page.  Use Ranorex to create a css locators for every field to use later in our test.  You can also right click 
and use Ranorex on the element directly to get the css locator.

6.  In order to add values to the fields in the form of the 'contact us' page, let us navigate to webdriver.io and search for the setValue function.

7.  Let us populate the values in our 'describe' block into the 'it' block functions using 'browser.setValue("['location of the field']", value)'.

8.  After populating test with data we recieved form Ranorex, open gitbash in the root directory of the project and run ' npm test -- --spec=tests/contactUsTest.js'
