Page Object Model(POM)

1. POM can be broken up into three phases:

Phase 1
-------
Centralizing Selectors
Improving our Existing Commands 

Phase 2
-------

Creating Seperate POM Classes
Link Test with POM Classes
Directly call POM Commands via Tests

Phase 3
-------

Centralizing all Selectors & Commands inside the POM Class(further Abstraction)
Simplifying Tests by applying all concepts from Phase 1, 2 & 3
