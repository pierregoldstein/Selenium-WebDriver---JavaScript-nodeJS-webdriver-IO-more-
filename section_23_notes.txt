Free Up Space - Deleting Files and Folders

Go into the 'wdio.conf.js' and use one the the hooks called 'beforeSession' and uncomment it.
Add the folder directories names and the 'del' library to git rid of the folders upon execution. E.g:
beforeSession: function (config, capabilities, specs) {
        const del = require('del');
        del(['allure-reports','erroShots','reports']);
    },

In git bash run 'npm install del --save-dev'

run 'npm test -- --spec=tests/ajaxclicktest.js'

You'll notice the folders named in the hook we confirgured in wdio file are deleted before execution then 
recreated after the test.
